# Branching/Merging-Concept
We use simple feature branches.
 - When you work on an issue, assign it to you.
 - Create a new branch for every merge request. The name of the branch should start with the number of the main according issue and continue with a descriptive text, e. g. "21_extend_readme_file".
 - Once you have solved the referencing issue open a pull request. Make sure to link the pull request to the according issue (e.g. mentioning "Closes #7" in the description).
 - A pull request must have at least two reviewers and should only be merged once all travis pipelines finish successfully. GitHub will enforce this.
 - Please delete unused feature branches. As a rule of thumb, the person who created the branch should be responsible for deleting it.
